# Predicting Hospital Readmission
## Overview

This project focuses on predicting hospital readmissions for patients with heart failure, pneumonia, and acute myocardial infarction using a dataset from Kaggle. The dataset includes demographic information, lab test results, medications, and various clinical factors.

Kaggle Dataset: Hospital Readmission

## Data Preprocessing

Missing Values: The dataset was verified to have no missing values, preserving its integrity.
Outlier Treatment: Outliers were retained as they represent valid medical records that provide important patient health information.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Label encoding was utilized to convert categorical variables into a numerical format suitable for analysis.
Feature Scaling: Standardization was applied to numerical features using Standard Scalar, ensuring equal contribution to model performance.
Model Selection
A logistic regression model was employed due to its interpretability, efficiency, and probabilistic output, making it ideal for this binary classification task.
